# Sprouty Labs ðŸŒ±


## About Us

We are working on creating Godot plugins and more GameDev related products. Our first rollout is
[SproutyDialogs](https://github.com/SproutyLabs/SproutyDialogs), a dialog system based on graphs with a
low-code approach; featuring CSV translations, characters/profiles, events & variables management and text
effects in a user-friendly editor.

We also make games!, Check out our current development [One Cake Day](https://kazymila.itch.io/one-cake-day).
Or our most recent delivery in Brackey's Game Jam, [Biscuits Mania](https://kazymila.itch.io/biscuit-mania)!


## Future Work

We are planning to start developing another plugin to solve many of our most common issues related to
pixel-art assets management in Godot.

We are also planning to release artwork for our brand (kitty involved) and pixel art assets for your 2D games,
so stay tunned!
